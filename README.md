<h1>Expamine alerts, logs and rules with Suricata  </h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In thia lab I explored suricata alerts and logs, including the general process of rule creation.
 
The Suricata tool monitors network interfaces and applies rules to the packets that pass through the interface. Suricata determines whether each packet should generate an alert and be dropped, rejected, or allowed to pass through the interface.

Source and destination networks must be specified in the Suricata configuration. Custom rules can be written to specify which traffic should be processed.

<h2>Scenario</h2>
In this scenario, I'm a security analyst who must monitor traffic on my employer's network. I’ll be required to configure Suricata and use it to trigger alerts.

Here’s how you'll do this task: First, I'll explore custom rules in Suricata. Second, I'll run Suricata with a custom rule in order to trigger it, and examine the output logs in the fast.log file. Finally, I'll examine the additional output that Suricata generates in the standard <i>eve.json</i> log file.

For the purposes of the tests in this lab activity, I’ve been supplied with a <i>sample.pcap</i> file and a <i>custom.rules</i> file. These reside in your home folder.

Let’s define the files you’ll be working with in this lab activity:

The <i>sample.pcap</i> file is a packet capture file that contains an example of network traffic data, which I’ll use to test the Suricata rules. This will allow me to simulate and repeat the exercise of monitoring network traffic.<br>

The <i>custom.rules</i> file contains a custom rule when the lab activity starts. I’ll add rules to this file and run them against the network traffic data in the <i>sample.pcap</i> file.

The <i>fast.log</i> file will contain the alerts that Suricata generates. The <i>fast.log</i> file is empty when the lab starts. Each time you test a rule, or set of rules, against the sample network traffic data, Suricata adds a new alert line to the <i>fast.log</i> file when all the conditions in any of the rules are met. The <i>fast.log</i> file can be located in the <i>/var/log/suricata</i> directory after Suricata <i>runs.The fast.log file</i> is considered to be a depreciated format and is not recommended for incident response or threat hunting tasks but can be used to perform quick checks or tasks related to quality assurance.

The <i>eve.json</i> file is the main, standard, and default log for events generated by Suricata. It contains detailed information about alerts triggered, as well as other network telemetry events, in JSON format. The <i>eve.json</i> file is generated when Suricate runs, and can also be located in the <i>/var/log/suricata</i> directory.

When I create a new rule, I'll need to test the rule to confirm whether or not it worked as expected. I will use the <i>fast.log</i> file to quickly compare the number of alerts generated each time you run Suricata to test a signature against the <i>sample.pcap</i> file.

<h2>Task 2.Trigger a custom rule in Suricata  </h2>

Before running Suricata, there are no files in the <i>/var/log/suricata</i> directory. <br>
After starting the Suricata application and processes the <i>sample.pcap</i> file uses the rules in the <i>custom.rules</i> file. It returns an output stating how many packets were processed by Suricata.<br>
The <i>-r sample.pcap</i> option specifies an input file to mimic network traffic. In this case, the <i>sample.pcap</i> file.<br>
The <i>-S custom.rules</i> option instructs Suricata to use the rules defined in the <i>custom.rules</i> file.<br>
The <i>-k none</i> option instructs Suricata to disable all checksum checks.<br>
<b>Checksums</b> are a way to detect if a packet has been modified in transit. Because I used network traffic from a sample packet capture file, I won't need Suricata to check the integrity of the checksum.<br>
Suricata adds a new alert line to the <i>/var/log/suricata/fast.log</i> file when all the conditions in any of the rules are met.<br>
<br>
Below I then listed the files in the <i>/var/log/suricata</i> folder again:<br>
<img src="https://github.com/Bridgetanntighe/Filter-SQL-II/assets/134883216/debe8797-1b17-4aa0-bbff-f2e0d6f9e54f" height="60%" width="60%" alt="Active Directory Lab"/><br>
After running Suricata, there are now four files in the <i>/var/log/suricata</i> directory, including the <i>fast.log</i> and <i>eve.json</i> files.<br>
<br>
Lets examine these files in more detail:<br>
<img src="https://github.com/Bridgetanntighe/Filter-SQL-II/assets/134883216/7b9565ae-4d24-4a32-bf76-62973b24cb7b" height="90%" width="90%" alt="Active Directory Lab"/><br>
Each line or entry in the <i>fast.log</i> file corresponds to an alert generated by Suricata when it processes a packet that meets the conditions of an alert generating rule. Each alert line includes the message that identifies the rule that triggered the alert, as well as the source, destination, and direction of the traffic.<br>


<h2>Task 3. Examine eve.json output</h2>
In this task, I examined the additional output that Suricata generates in the <i>eve.json</i> file.<br>
As previously mentioned, this file is located in the <i>/var/log/suricata/</i> directory.<br>
(screenshot of cat)
1. Using the <i>cat</i>command to display the entries in the <i>eve.json</i>file:
<img src="https://github.com/Bridgetanntighe/FilterSQLTheory/assets/134883216/e240ad3a-0a09-4e60-9c7c-d67b512c4afe" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Active Directory Lab"/><br>
The output returns the raw content of the file. There is a lot of data returned and is not easy to understand in this format.<br>
2. I then used the <i>jq</i> command to display the entries in an improved format.<br>
(screenshot of this format)
<img src="https://github.com/Bridgetanntighe/FilterSQLTheory/assets/134883216/e240ad3a-0a09-4e60-9c7c-d67b512c4afe" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Active Directory Lab"/>
It is now much easier to read the output as opposed to the <i>cat</i> command output <br>
<b>Note:</b><i>The jq tool is very useful for processing JSON data, however, a full explanation of its capabilities is outside of the scope of this lab.<br></i>
It shows the value of the severity property for the first alert is 3.<br>
<br>
3. Press <b>Q</b> to exit the <i>less</i> command and to return to the command-line prompt.

4.Below I used the <i>jq</i> command to extract specific data from the <i>eve.json</i>file:
<img src="https://github.com/Bridgetanntighe/FilterSQLTheory/assets/134883216/e240ad3a-0a09-4e60-9c7c-d67b512c4afe" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Active Directory Lab"/>
<b><i>Note:</b>: The jq command above extracts the fields specified in the list in the square brackets from the JSON payload. The fields selected are the timestamp (.timestamp), the flow id (.flow_id), the alert signature or msg (.alert.signature), the protocol (.proto), and the destination IP address (.dest_ip).</i> 
The destination IP address is 142.250.1.102.<br>
The first event in the eve.json file has "GET on WIRE" as the alert signature.<br>
<img src="https://github.com/Bridgetanntighe/FilterSQLTheory/assets/134883216/e240ad3a-0a09-4e60-9c7c-d67b512c4afe" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Active Directory Lab"/><br>
 
5. Use the jq command to display all event logs related to a specific flow_id from the eve.json file. The flow_id value is a 16-digit number and will vary for each of the log entries. Replace X with any of the flow_id values returned by the previous query:

<b><i>Note:</b>A network flow refers to a sequence of packets between a source and destination that share common characteristics such as IP addresses, protocols, and more. In cybersecurity, network traffic flows help analysts understand the behavior of network traffic to identify and analyze threats. Suricata assigns a unique flow_id to each network flow. All logs from a network flow share the same flow_id. This makes the flow_id field a useful field for correlating network traffic that belongs to the same network flows.</i>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>
This filters to packets containing web requests made with the <i>curl</i> command in this sample packet capture file.
